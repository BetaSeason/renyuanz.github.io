**[Ricetorun.com](https://www.ricetorun.com/)**, Chinese food delivery platform, Owner

*March 2015 - present*

France

This is a side-project made to help Chinese who live in France find delicious Chinese style restaurants and order food online. I've started this project in order to test my coding skills and see how far I can get to as a developer and product owner as well. I used some recent technologies such as:

- [Ruby on Rails](http://rubyonrails.org/) to build backend. Rails is no longer a recent backend framework but something I really love. It gives me a productive, efficient and funny way to write server-side code.
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) to build user interface.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to deploy my application to DigitalOceans VPS.

Things I have tried:

- Using ActionCable, new feature in Rails 5 to easily build real-time communication over WebSockets, to make real-time notification when order's status changes.
- Writing API endpoints with Rails 5 API mode.
- Clean but complexe ordering page with React.js to make Javascript code more readable, maintainable and even reusable.
- Making deployment easy by packing Rails application, nginx, postgresql, redis into docker and monitoring using Slack bot notification, which saved me days and money to deploy.

Ruby gems heavily used in the project:

Rails 5 (for sure), Devise (Authentication), minitest (Testing), sidekiq (Background jobs), aasm (State Machine), activeadmin (Admin Interface), carrierwave (Files uploading), etc..
